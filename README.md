# Leetcode
A compilation of my solved Leetcode problems. Note: This is not currently an exhaustive list.

Three classes of Leetcode problems are represented in these files: easy, medium, and hard. Any specific example will be denoted within the respective class (i.e. EasySolutions), as name_number().
## Running the Problem Solver
Each respective class has the method run_problem(number), which accepts a number (particularly the problem number specified on Leetcode), will print the description of the problem, ask for an example to be specified, and return the solution:

```python
easy = EasySolutions()

easy.run_problem(7)

# runs problem 7 - Reverse Integer
```
