# Leetcode
A compilation of Leetcode problems that I've solved.

Three classes of Leetcode problems are represented in these files: easy, medium, and hard. Any specific example will be denoted within the respective class (i.e. EasySolutions), as name_number().

Each respective class has the method run_problem(number), in which it accepts a number, will print the description of the problem, ask for an example to be specified, and return the solution:

```python
easy = EasySolutions()

easy.run_problem(7)

# runs problem 7 - Reverse Integer
```
